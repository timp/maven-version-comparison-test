This repository was intended to show that a proposed versioning scheme would work, 
it shows that that proposal does not work, nor the next and finally shows that the only versioning 
schema that works is digits and fullstops. 

## Proposal 1 - PRJ103-2.0.3
## Proposal 2 - 2024-PRJ103-2.0.3
## Proposal 1 - 1.103.2024.2.0.3
